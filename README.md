# PwC-Call-Centre-Analysis
Visualising customer and agent behaviour.


Enjoyed working on this project because it gave ne insight on understanding how calls and call agent manage their time across various departments.

This Powe BI dashboard reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.

• Overall customer satisfaction
• Overall calls answered/abandoned
• Calls by time
• Average speed of answer
• Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
